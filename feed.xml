        <title>Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;LogIsland is an event mining platform based on spark and Kafka to ingest a huge amount of log files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please follow the &lt;a href=&quot;/getting-started&quot;&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt; if you want to start playing right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;First public release&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece of software was born on mid 2013 as a log analysis tool that tried to detect malwares from Cisco firewall logs.
It has been is production since then, and had experienced several reworks to simplify the technological stack.
At first it was designed as a workflow of Flume agents, Pig ETL jobs and Mahout machine learning Map/reduce routines, but 
now it has evolved into a Spark/Kafka &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is now released as an OpenSource framework to help you scale and expand your traditionnal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/downloads&quot;&gt;ELK&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://flume.apache.org/&quot;&gt;FLume&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://hadoop.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Hadoop&lt;/a&gt; stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Additional advanced plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original analytic part has been removed to an external plugin called Botsearch which is available on demand at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@hurence.com&quot;&gt;contact@hurence.com&lt;/a&gt;
but not as Open Source&lt;/p&gt;
