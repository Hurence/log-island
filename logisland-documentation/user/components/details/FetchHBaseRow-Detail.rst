Fetches a row from an HBase table. The Destination property controls whether the cells are added as flow file attributes, or the row is written to the flow file content as JSON. This processor may be used to fetch a fixed row on a interval by specifying the table and row id directly in the processor, or it may be used to dynamically fetch rows by referencing the table and row id from incoming flow files.
