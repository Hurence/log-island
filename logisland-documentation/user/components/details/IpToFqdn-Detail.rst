Translates an IP address into a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). An input field from the record has the IP as value. An new field is created and its value is the FQDN matching the IP address. The resolution mechanism is based on the underlying operating system. The resolution request may take some time, specially if the IP address cannot be translated into a FQDN. For these reasons this processor relies on the logisland cache service so that once a resolution occurs or not, the result is put into the cache. That way, the real request for the same IP is not re-triggered during a certain period of time, until the cache entry expires. This timeout is configurable but by default a request for the same IP is not triggered before 24 hours to let the time to the underlying DNS system to be potentially updated.
