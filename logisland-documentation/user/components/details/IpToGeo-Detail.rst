Looks up geolocation information for an IP address. The attribute that contains the IP address to lookup must be provided in the **ip.address.field** property. By default, the geo information are put in a hierarchical structure. That is, if the name of the IP field is 'X', then the the geo attributes added by enrichment are added under a father field named X_geo. "_geo" is the default hierarchical suffix that may be changed with the **geo.hierarchical.suffix** property. If one wants to put the geo fields at the same level as the IP field, then the **geo.hierarchical** property should be set to false and then the geo attributes are  created at the same level as him with the naming pattern X_geo_<geo_field>. "_geo_" is the default flat suffix but this may be changed with the **geo.flat.suffix** property. The IpToGeo processor requires a reference to an Ip to Geo service. This must be defined in the **iptogeo.service** property. The added geo fields are dependant on the underlying Ip to Geo service. The **geo.fields** property must contain the list of geo fields that should be created if data is available for  the IP to resolve. This property defaults to "*" which means to add every available fields. If one only wants a subset of the fields,  one must define a comma separated list of fields as a value for the **geo.fields** property. The list of the available geo fields is in the description of the **geo.fields** property.
