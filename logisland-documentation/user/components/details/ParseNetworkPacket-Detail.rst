The ParseNetworkPacket processor is the LogIsland entry point to parse network packets captured either off-the-wire (stream mode) or in pcap format (batch mode).  In batch mode, the processor decodes the bytes of the incoming pcap record, where a Global header followed by a sequence of [packet header, packet data] pairs are stored. Then, each incoming pcap event is parsed into n packet records. The fields of packet headers are then extracted and made available in dedicated record fields. See the `Capturing Network packets tutorial <http://logisland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/indexing-network-packets.html>`_ for an example of usage of this processor.
