Evaluates one or more JsonPath expressions against the content of a FlowFile. The results of those expressions are assigned to Records Fields depending on configuration of the Processor. JsonPaths are entered by adding user-defined properties; the name of the property maps to the Field Name into which the result will be placed. The value of the property must be a valid JsonPath expression. A Return Type of 'auto-detect' will make a determination based off the configured destination. If the JsonPath evaluates to a JSON array or JSON object and the Return Type is set to 'scalar' the Record will be routed to error. A Return Type of JSON can return scalar values if the provided JsonPath evaluates to the specified value. If the expression matches nothing, Fields will be created with empty strings as the value.
