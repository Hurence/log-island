The SetJsonAsFields processor reads the content of a string field containing a json  string and sets each json attribute as a field of the current record. Note that this could be achieved with the EvaluateJsonPath processor, but this implies to declare each json first level attribute in the configuration and also to know by advance every one of them. Whereas for this simple case, the SetJsonAsFields processor does not require such a configuration and will work with any incoming json, regardless of the list of first level attributes.
