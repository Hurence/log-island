Evaluates one or more XPaths against the content of a record. The results of those XPaths are assigned to new attributes in the records, depending on configuration of the Processor. XPaths are entered by adding user-defined properties; the name of the property maps to the Attribute Name into which the result will be placed. The value of the property must be a valid XPath expression. If the expression matches nothing, no attributes is added.
