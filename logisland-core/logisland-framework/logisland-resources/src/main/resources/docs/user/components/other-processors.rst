.. _com.hurence.logisland.processor.useragent.ParseUserAgent: 

ParseUserAgent
--------------
The user-agent processor allows to decompose User-Agent value from an HTTP header into several attributes of interest. There is no standard format for User-Agent strings, hence it is not easily possible to use regexp to handle them. This processor rely on the `YAUAA library <https://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa>`_ to do the heavy work.

If the distance from the last event is beyond a given threshold (by default 30mn), then the session is considered closed.The ConsolidateSession is building an aggregated session object for each active session.This aggregated object includes: - The actual session duration. - A boolean representing wether the session is considered active or closed.   Note: it is possible to ressurect a session if for instance an event arrives after a session has been marked closed. - User related infos: userId, B2Bunit code, groupCode, userRoles, companyId - First visited page: URL - Last visited page: URL The properties to configure the processor are: - sessionid.field:          Property name containing the session identifier (default: sessionId). - timestamp.field:          Property name containing the timestamp of the event (default: timestamp). - session.timeout:          Timeframe of inactivity (in seconds) after which a session is considered closed (default: 30mn). - visitedpage.field:        Property name containing the page visited by the customer (default: location). - fields.to.return:         List of fields to return in the aggregated object.

.. _com.hurence.logisland.processor.DetectOutliers: 

DetectOutliers
--------------
Outlier Analysis: A Hybrid Approach

In order to function at scale, a two-phase approach is taken

For every data point

- Detect outlier candidates using a robust estimator of variability (e.g. median absolute deviation) that uses distributional sketching (e.g. Q-trees)
- Gather a biased sample (biased by recency)
- Extremely deterministic in space and cheap in computation

For every outlier candidate

- Use traditional, more computationally complex approaches to outlier analysis (e.g. Robust PCA) on the biased sample
- Expensive computationally, but run infrequently

This becomes a data filter which can be attached to a timeseries data stream within a distributed computational framework (i.e. Storm, Spark, Flink, NiFi) to detect outliers.

.. _com.hurence.logisland.processor.webAnalytics.IncrementalWebSession: 

IncrementalWebSession
---------------------
This processor creates and updates web-sessions based on incoming web-events. Note that both web-sessions and web-events are stored in elasticsearch.
 Firstly, web-events are grouped by their session identifier and processed in chronological order.
 Then each web-session associated to each group is retrieved from elasticsearch.
 In case none exists yet then a new web session is created based on the first web event.
 The following fields of the newly created web session are set based on the associated web event: session identifier, first timestamp, first visited page. Secondly, once created, or retrieved, the web session is updated by the remaining web-events.
 Updates have impacts on fields of the web session such as event counter, last visited page,  session duration, ...
 Before updates are actually applied, checks are performed to detect rules that would trigger the creation of a new session:

	the duration between the web session and the web event must not exceed the specified time-out,
	the web session and the web event must have timestamps within the same day (at midnight a new web session is created),
	source of traffic (campaign, ...) must be the same on the web session and the web event.

 When a breaking rule is detected, a new web session is created with a new session identifier where as remaining web-events still have the original session identifier. The new session identifier is the original session suffixed with the character '#' followed with an incremented counter. This new session identifier is also set on the remaining web-events.
 Finally when all web events were applied, all web events -potentially modified with a new session identifier- are save in elasticsearch. And web sessions are passed to the next processor.

WebSession information are:
- first and last visited page
- first and last timestamp of processed event 
- total number of processed events
- the userId
- a boolean denoting if the web-session is still active or not
- an integer denoting the duration of the web-sessions
- optional fields that may be retrieved from the processed events

.. _com.hurence.logisland.processor.enrichment.IpToFqdn: 

IpToFqdn
--------
Translates an IP address into a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). An input field from the record has the IP as value. An new field is created and its value is the FQDN matching the IP address. The resolution mechanism is based on the underlying operating system. The resolution request may take some time, specially if the IP address cannot be translated into a FQDN. For these reasons this processor relies on the logisland cache service so that once a resolution occurs or not, the result is put into the cache. That way, the real request for the same IP is not re-triggered during a certain period of time, until the cache entry expires. This timeout is configurable but by default a request for the same IP is not triggered before 24 hours to let the time to the underlying DNS system to be potentially updated.

IpToGeo
-------
Looks up geolocation information for an IP address. The attribute that contains the IP address to lookup must be provided in the **ip.address.field** property. By default, the geo information are put in a hierarchical structure. That is, if the name of the IP field is 'X', then the the geo attributes added by enrichment are added under a father field named X_geo. "_geo" is the default hierarchical suffix that may be changed with the **geo.hierarchical.suffix** property. If one wants to put the geo fields at the same level as the IP field, then the **geo.hierarchical** property should be set to false and then the geo attributes are  created at the same level as him with the naming pattern X_geo_<geo_field>. "_geo_" is the default flat suffix but this may be changed with the **geo.flat.suffix** property. The IpToGeo processor requires a reference to an Ip to Geo service. This must be defined in the **iptogeo.service** property. The added geo fields are dependant on the underlying Ip to Geo service. The **geo.fields** property must contain the list of geo fields that should be created if data is available for  the IP to resolve. This property defaults to "*" which means to add every available fields. If one only wants a subset of the fields,  one must define a comma separated list of fields as a value for the **geo.fields** property. The list of the available geo fields is in the description of the **geo.fields** property.

.. _com.hurence.logisland.processor.bro.ParseBroEvent: 

ParseBroEvent
-------------
The ParseBroEvent processor is the Logisland entry point to get and process `Bro <https://www.bro.org>`_ events. The `Bro-Kafka plugin <https://github.com/bro/bro-plugins/tree/master/kafka>`_ should be used and configured in order to have Bro events sent to Kafka. See the `Bro/Logisland tutorial <http://logisland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/indexing-bro-events.html>`_ for an example of usage for this processor. The ParseBroEvent processor does some minor pre-processing on incoming Bro events from the Bro-Kafka plugin to adapt them to Logisland.

Basically the events coming from the Bro-Kafka plugin are JSON documents with a first level field indicating the type of the event. The ParseBroEvent processor takes the incoming JSON document, sets the event type in a record_type field and sets the original sub-fields of the JSON event as first level fields in the record. Also any dot in a field name is transformed into an underscore. Thus, for instance, the field id.orig_h becomes id_orig_h. The next processors in the stream can then process the Bro events generated by this ParseBroEvent processor.

As an example here is an incoming event from Bro:

{

   "conn": {

     "id.resp_p": 9092,

     "resp_pkts": 0,

     "resp_ip_bytes": 0,

     "local_orig": true,

     "orig_ip_bytes": 0,

     "orig_pkts": 0,

     "missed_bytes": 0,

     "history": "Cc",

     "tunnel_parents": [],

     "id.orig_p": 56762,

     "local_resp": true,

     "uid": "Ct3Ms01I3Yc6pmMZx7",

     "conn_state": "OTH",

     "id.orig_h": "172.17.0.2",

     "id.resp_h": "172.17.0.3",

     "ts": 1487596886.953917

   }

 }

It gets processed and transformed into the following Logisland record by the ParseBroEvent processor:

"@timestamp": "2017-02-20T13:36:32Z"

"record_id": "6361f80a-c5c9-4a16-9045-4bb51736333d"

-----------------
The `Netflow V5 <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/solutions_docs/netflow/nfwhite.html>`_ processor is the Logisland entry point to  process Netflow (V5) events. NetFlow is a feature introduced on Cisco routers that provides the ability to collect IP network traffic.We can distinguish 2 components:

	- Flow exporter: aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records (binary format) towards one or more flow collectors

	- Flow collector: responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow data received from a flow exporter

The collected data are then available for analysis purpose (intrusion detection, traffic analysis...)
Netflow are sent to kafka in order to be processed by logisland.
In the tutorial we will simulate Netflow traffic using `nfgen <https://github.com/pazdera/NetFlow-Exporter-Simulator>`_. this traffic will be sent to port 2055. The we rely on nifi to listen of that port for   incoming netflow (V5) traffic and send them to a kafka topic. The Netflow processor could thus treat these events and generate corresponding logisland records. The following processors in the stream can then process the Netflow records generated by this processor.

ParseNetworkPacket
------------------
The ParseNetworkPacket processor is the LogIsland entry point to parse network packets captured either off-the-wire (stream mode) or in pcap format (batch mode).  In batch mode, the processor decodes the bytes of the incoming pcap record, where a Global header followed by a sequence of [packet header, packet data] pairs are stored. Then, each incoming pcap event is parsed into n packet records. The fields of packet headers are then extracted and made available in dedicated record fields. See the `Capturing Network packets tutorial <http://logisland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/indexing-network-packets.html>`_ for an example of usage of this processor.

.. _com.hurence.logisland.processor.scripting.python.RunPython: 

RunPython
---------
 !!!! WARNING !!!!

The RunPython processor is currently an experimental feature : it is delivered as is, with the current set of features and is subject to modifications in API or anything else in further logisland releases without warnings. There is no tutorial yet. If you want to play with this processor, use the python-processing.yml example and send the apache logs of the index apache logs tutorial. The debug stream processor at the end of the stream should output events in stderr file of the executors from the spark console.

This processor allows to implement and run a processor written in python. This can be done in 2 ways. Either directly defining the process method code in the **script.code.process** configuration property or poiting to an external python module script file in the **script.path** configuration property. Directly defining methods is called the inline mode whereas using a script file is called the file mode. Both ways are mutually exclusive. Whether using the inline of file mode, your python code may depend on some python dependencies. If the set of python dependencies already delivered with the Logisland framework is not sufficient, you can use the **dependencies.path** configuration property to give their location. Currently only the nltk python library is delivered with Logisland.

SampleRecords
-------------
Query matching based on `Luwak <http://www.confluent.io/blog/real-time-full-text-search-with-luwak-and-samza/>`_

you can use this processor to handle custom events defined by lucene queries
a new record is added to output each time a registered query is matched

A query is expressed as a lucene query against a field like for example: 

.. code::

   message:'bad exception'
   error_count:[10 TO *]
   bytes_out:5000
   user_name:tom*

Please read the `Lucene syntax guide <https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_5_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package_description>`_ for supported operations

.. warning::
   don't forget to set numeric fields property to handle correctly numeric ranges queries

.. _com.hurence.logisland.processor.webAnalytics.setSourceOfTraffic: 

setSourceOfTraffic
------------------
Compute the source of traffic of a web session. Users arrive at a website or application through a variety of sources, 
including advertising/paying campaigns, search engines, social networks, referring sites or direct access. 
When analysing user experience on a webshop, it is crucial to collect, process, and report the campaign and traffic-source data. 
To compute the source of traffic of a web session, the user has to provide the utm_* related properties if available
i-e: **utm_source.field**, **utm_medium.field**, **utm_campaign.field**, **utm_content.field**, **utm_term.field**)
, the referer (**referer.field** property) and the first visited page of the session (**first.visited.page.field** property).
By default the source of traffic information are placed in a flat structure (specified by the **source_of_traffic.suffix** property
with a default value of source_of_traffic). To work properly the setSourceOfTraffic processor needs to have access to an 
Elasticsearch index containing a list of the most popular search engines and social networks. The ES index (specified by the **es.index** property) should be structured such that the _id of an ES document MUST be the name of the domain. If the domain is a search engine, the related ES doc MUST have a boolean field (default being search_engine) specified by the property **es.search_engine.field** with a value set to true. If the domain is a social network , the related ES doc MUST have a boolean field (default being social_network) specified by the property **es.social_network.field** with a value set to true.
