Capturing Network packets in Logisland
======================================

1. Network Packets
------------------
A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a network from one computer (or device) to another. For example, a web page or an email are carried as a series of packets of a certain size in bytes. Each packet carries the information that will help it get to its destination : the sender's IP address, the intended receiver's IP address, something that tells the network how many packets the message has been broken into, ...

Packet Headers
______________
**1. Protocol headers (IP, TCP, …)**

This information is stored in different layers called “headers”, encapsulating the packet payload. For example, a TCP/IP packet is wrapped in a `TCP header <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure>`_, which is in turn encapsulated in an `IP header <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Header>`_.

The individual packets for a given file or message may travel different routes through the Internet. When they have all arrived, they are reassembled by the TCP layer at the receiving end.

**2. PCAP format specific headers**

Packets can be either analysed in real-time (stream mode) or stored in files for upcoming analysis (batch mode). In the latter case, the packets are stored in the pcap format, adding some specific headers :

- a `global header <https://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat#Global_Header>`_ is added in the beginning of the pcap file
- a `packet header <https://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat#Record_.28Packet.29_Header>`_ is added in front of each packet

In this tutorial we are going to **capture packets in live stream mode**

Why capturing network packets ?
_______________________________
Packet sniffing, or packet analysis, is the process of capturing any data transmitted over the local network and searching for any information that may be useful for :

- Troubleshooting network problems
- Detecting network intrusion attempts
- Detecting network misuse by internal and external users
- Monitoring network bandwidth utilization
- Monitoring network and endpoint security status
- Gathering and report network statistics

Packets information collected by Logisland
__________________________________________
LogIsland parses all the fields of IP protocol headers, namely :

**1. IP Header fields**

- IP version : ip_version
- Internet Header Length : ip_internet_header_length
- Type of Service : ip_type_of_service
- Datagram Total Length : ip_datagram_total_length
- Identification : ip_identification
- Flags : ip_flags
- Fragment offset : ip_fragment_offset
- Time To Live : ip_time_to_live
- Protocol : protocol
- Header Checksum : ip_checksum
- Source IP address : src_ip
- Destination IP address : dst_ip
- Options : ip_options (variable size)
- Padding : ip_padding (variable size)

**2. TCP Header fields**

- Source port number : src_port
- Destination port number : dest_port
- Sequence Number : tcp_sequence_number
- Acknowledgment Number : tcp_acknowledgment_number
- Data offset : tcp_data_offset
- Flags : tcp_flags
- Window size : tcp_window_size
- Checksum : tcp_checksum
- Urgent Pointer : tcp_urgent_pointer
- Options : tcp_options (variable size)
- Padding : tcp_padding (variable size)

**3. UDP Header fields**

- Source port number : src_port
- Destination port number : dest_port
- Segment total length : udp_segment_total_length
- Checksum : udp_checksum

2. Tutorial environment
-----------------------
This tutorial aims to show how to capture live Network Packets and process then in LogIsland. Through its out-of-the-box ParseNetworkPacket processor, LogIsland is able to receive and handle network packets captured by a packet sniffer tool.
Using LogIsland, you will be able to inspect those packets for network security, optimization or monitoring reasons.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to capture network packets, process those packets in LogIsland, index them in ElasticSearch and then display them in Kibana.

We will launch two streaming processors, one for parsing Network Packets into LogIsland packet records, and one to index those packet records in ElasticSearch.

Packet Capture Tool
___________________
For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to capture network packets (off-the-wire) into a kafka topic using `pycapa <https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/tree/master/metron-sensors/pycapa>`_ Apache probe, a tool based on `Pcapy <https://github.com/CoreSecurity/pcapy>`_, a Python extension module that interfaces with the `libpcap <http://www.tcpdump.org>`_ packet capture library.

For information, it is also possible to use the `fastcapa <https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/tree/master/metron-sensors/fastcapa>`_ Apache probe, based on `DPDK <http://dpdk.org/>`_, intended for high-volume packet capture.

.. note::

   You can download the `latest release <https://github.com/Hurence/logisland/releases>`_ of LogIsland and the `YAML configuration file <https://github.com/Hurence/logisland/blob/master/logisland-framework/logisland-resources/src/main/resources/conf/index-network-packets.yml>`_
   for this tutorial which can be also found under `$LOGISLAND_HOME/conf` directory in the LogIsland container.

3. Start LogIsland as a Docker container
----------------------------------------
LogIsland is packaged as a Docker container that you can build yourself or pull from Docker Hub.
The docker container is built from a Centos 6.4 image with the following tools enabled (among others)

- Kafka
- Spark
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana
- LogIsland

Pull the image from Docker Repository (it may take some time)

.. code-block:: sh

    docker pull hurence/logisland

You should be aware that this Docker container is quite eager in RAM and will need at least 8G of memory to run smoothly.
Now run the container

.. code-block:: sh

    # run container
    docker run \
        -it \
        -p 80:80 \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        -p 3000:3000 \
        -p 9200-9300:9200-9300 \
        -p 5601:5601 \
        -p 2181:2181 \
        -p 9092:9092 \
        -p 9000:9000 \
        -p 4050-4060:4050-4060 \
        --name logisland \
        -h sandbox \
        hurence/logisland bash

    # get container ip
    docker inspect logisland

    # or if your are on mac os
    docker-machine ip default

you should add an entry for **sandbox** (with the container ip) in your ``/etc/hosts`` as it will be easier to access to all web services in logisland running container.


.. note::

    If you have your own Spark and Kafka cluster, you can download the `latest release <https://github.com/Hurence/logisland/releases>`_ and unzip on an edge node.

4. Parse Network Packets
------------------------
In this tutorial we will capture network packets, process those packets in LogIsland and index them in ElasticSearch.

Connect a shell to your logisland container to launch LogIsland streaming jobs :

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -ti logisland bash
    cd $LOGISLAND_HOME
    bin/logisland.sh --conf conf/index-network-packets.yml

Setup Spark/Kafka streaming engine
__________________________________
An Engine is needed to handle the stream processing. This ``conf/index-network-packets.yml`` configuration file defines a stream processing job setup.
The first section configures the Spark engine, we will use a `KafkaStreamProcessingEngine <../plugins.html#kafkastreamprocessingengine>`_ :

.. code-block:: yaml

 engine:
  component: com.hurence.logisland.engine.spark.KafkaStreamProcessingEngine
  type: engine
  documentation: Parse network packets with LogIsland
  configuration:
    spark.app.name: ParseNetworkPacketDemo
    spark.master: local[4]
    spark.driver.memory: 1G
    spark.driver.cores: 1
    spark.executor.memory: 2G
    spark.executor.instances: 4
    spark.executor.cores: 2
    spark.yarn.queue: default
    spark.yarn.maxAppAttempts: 4
    spark.yarn.am.attemptFailuresValidityInterval: 1h
    spark.yarn.max.executor.failures: 20
    spark.yarn.executor.failuresValidityInterval: 1h
    spark.task.maxFailures: 8

    spark.streaming.batchDuration: 4000
    spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled: false
    spark.streaming.unpersist: false
    spark.streaming.blockInterval: 500
    spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition: 3000
    spark.streaming.timeout: -1
    spark.streaming.unpersist: false
    spark.streaming.kafka.maxRetries: 3
    spark.streaming.ui.retainedBatches: 200
    spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable: false
    spark.ui.port: 4050

  controllerServiceConfigurations:

    - controllerService: elasticsearch_service
      component: com.hurence.logisland.service.elasticsearch.Elasticsearch_2_4_0_ClientService
      type: service
      documentation: elasticsearch 2.4.0 service implementation
      configuration:
        hosts: sandbox:9300
        cluster.name: elasticsearch
        batch.size: 4000

  streamConfigurations:

Stream 1 : parse incoming Network Packets
_________________________________________
Inside this engine you will run a Kafka stream of processing, so we setup input/output topics and Kafka/Zookeeper hosts.
Here the stream will read all the logs sent in ``logisland_input_packets_topic`` topic and push the processed packet records into ``logisland_parsed_packets_topic`` topic.

We can define some serializers to marshall all records from and to a topic.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Parsing
    - stream: parsing_stream
      component: com.hurence.logisland.stream.spark.KafkaRecordStreamParallelProcessing
      type: stream
      documentation: A processor chain that parses network packets into Logisland records
      configuration:
        kafka.input.topics: logisland_input_packets_topic
        kafka.output.topics: logisland_parsed_packets_topic
        kafka.error.topics: logisland_error_packets_topic
        kafka.input.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.BytesArraySerializer
        kafka.output.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.KryoSerializer
        kafka.error.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.JsonSerializer
        kafka.metadata.broker.list: sandbox:9092
        kafka.zookeeper.quorum: sandbox:2181
        kafka.topic.autoCreate: true
        kafka.topic.default.partitions: 2
        kafka.topic.default.replicationFactor: 1
      processorConfigurations:

Within this stream there is a single processor in the processor chain: the ParseNetworkPacket processor. It takes an incoming network packet, parses it and computes a LogIsland record as a sequence of fields corresponding to packet headers fields.

.. code-block:: yaml

        # Transform network packets into LogIsland packet records
        - processor: ParseNetworkPacket processor
          component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.networkpacket.ParseNetworkPacket
          type: parser
          documentation: A processor that parses network packets into LogIsland records
          configuration:
            debug: true
            flow.mode: stream

This stream will process network packets as soon as they will be queued into ``logisland_input_packets_topic`` Kafka topic, each packet will be parsed as a record which will be pushed back to Kafka in the ``logisland_parsed_packets_topic`` topic.

Stream 2: Index the processed records into Elasticsearch
________________________________________________________

The second Kafka stream will handle ``Records`` pushed into the ``logisland_parsed_packets_topic`` topic to index them into ElasticSearch. So there is no need to define an output topic:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Indexing
    - stream: indexing_stream
      component: com.hurence.logisland.stream.spark.KafkaRecordStreamParallelProcessing
      type: processor
      documentation: a processor that pushes events to ES
      configuration:
        kafka.input.topics: logisland_parsed_packets_topic
        kafka.output.topics: none
        kafka.error.topics: logisland_error_packets_topic
        kafka.input.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.KryoSerializer
        kafka.output.topics.serializer: none
        kafka.error.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.JsonSerializer
        kafka.metadata.broker.list: sandbox:9092
        kafka.zookeeper.quorum: sandbox:2181
        kafka.topic.autoCreate: true
        kafka.topic.default.partitions: 2
        kafka.topic.default.replicationFactor: 1
      processorConfigurations:

The only processor in the processor chain of this stream is the ``BulkAddElasticsearch`` processor.

.. code-block:: yaml

        # Bulk add into ElasticSearch
        - processor: ES Publisher
          component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.elasticsearch.BulkAddElasticsearch
          type: processor
          documentation: A processor that pushes network packet records into ES
          configuration:
            elasticsearch.client.service: elasticsearch_service
            default.index: packets_index
            default.type: events
            timebased.index: today
            es.index.field: search_index
            es.type.field: record_type

The ``default.index: packets_index`` configuration parameter tells the elasticsearch processor to index records into an index starting with the ``packets_index`` string.
The ``timebased.index: today`` configuration parameter tells the processor to use the current date after the index prefix. Thus the index name is of the form ``/packets_index.2017.03.30``.

Finally, the ``es.type.field: record_type`` configuration parameter tells the processor to use the
record field ``record_type`` of the incoming record to determine the ElasticSearch type to use within the index.

5. Stream network packets into the system
-----------------------------------------
Let’s install and use the Apache pycapa probe to capture and send packets to kafka topics in real time.

Install pycapa probe
____________________
All required steps to install pycapa probe are explained in `this site <https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/tree/master/metron-sensors/pycapa>`_, but here are the main installation steps :

1. Install libpcap, pip (python-pip) and python-devel :

.. code-block:: sh

  yum install libpcap
  yum install python-pip
  yum install python-devel


2. Build pycapa probe from Metron repo

.. code-block:: sh

  cd /tmp
  git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron.git
  cd incubator-metron/metron-sensors/pycapa
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python setup.py install

Capture network packets
_______________________
To start capturing network packets into the topic ``logisland_input_packets_topic`` using pycapa probe, use the following command :

.. code-block:: sh

  pycapa --producer --kafka sandbox:9092 --topic logisland_input_packets_topic -i eth0

6. Monitor your spark jobs and Kafka topics
-------------------------------------------
Now go to `http://sandbox:4050/streaming/ <http://sandbox:4050/streaming/>`_ to see how fast Spark can process
your data

  .. image:: /_static/spark-streaming-packet-capture-job.png

7. Use Kibana to inspect records
--------------------------------

Inspect Network Packets under ``Discover`` tab
______________________________________________

Open your browser and go to `http://sandbox:5601/ <http://sandbox:5601/app/kibana#/settings/indices/?_g=(refreshInterval:(display:Off,pause:!f,value:0),time:(from:now-15m,mode:quick,to:now))>`_

Configure a new index pattern with ``packets.*`` as the pattern name and ``@timestamp`` as the time value field.

  .. image:: /_static/kibana-configure-index-packet.png


Then browse `"Discover" <http://sandbox:5601/app/kibana#/discover?_g=(refreshInterval:(display:'5%20seconds',pause:!f,section:1,value:5000),time:(from:now-1h,mode:relative,to:now))>`_ tab, you should be able to explore your network packet records :
