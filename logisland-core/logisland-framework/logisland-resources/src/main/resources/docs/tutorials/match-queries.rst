Alerting & Query Matching
=========================

In the following tutorial we'll learn how to raise custom alerts on some http traffic (apache log records) based on lucene matching query criterion.

We assume that you already know how to parse and ingest Apache logs into logisland.
If it's not the case please refer to the previous `Apache logs indexing tutorial <./index-apache-logs.html>`_.
We will use mainly the `MatchQuery </plugins.html#matchquery>`_ Processor.


.. note::

    Be sure to know of to launch a logisland Docker environment by reading the `prerequisites <./prerequisites.html>`_ section


1.Install required components
-----------------------------

For this tutorial please make sure to already have installed elasticsearch modules.

If not you can just do it through the components.sh command line:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/components.sh -i com.hurence.logisland:logisland-processor-elasticsearch:1.1.2

    bin/components.sh -i com.hurence.logisland:logisland-service-elasticsearch_5_4_0-client:1.1.2


2. Logisland job setup
----------------------
The logisland job for this tutorial is already packaged in the tar.gz assembly and you can find it here :

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -i -t logisland vim conf/match-queries.yml


We will start by explaining each part of the config file.


The stream contains two processors quite identical (the first one converts raw logs to records and the second one index records to ES) to those encountered in the previous `Apache logs indexing tutorial <./index-apache-logs.html>`_ tutorial .

The third one makes use of the `MatchQuery <plugins.html#matchquery>`_ Processor. This processor provides user with dynamic query registration.
This queries are expressed in the Lucene syntax.

.. note::

    Please read the `Lucene syntax guide <https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_5_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package_description>`_ for supported operations.


This processor will tag the record with ``blacklisted_host`` field if the query ``src_ip:(+alyssa +prodigy)`` matches and tag ``montana_host`` if ``src_ip:montana``

.. code-block:: yaml

    - processor: match_query
      component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.MatchQuery
      type: processor
      documentation: a parser that matches lucene queries on records
      configuration:
        policy.onmiss: forward
        policy.onmatch: all
        blacklisted_host: src_ip:(+alyssa +prodigy)
        montana_host: src_ip:montana


here is an example of matching record :

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "@timestamp": "1995-07-01T09:02:18+02:00",
        "alert_match_name": [
          "montana_host"
        ],
        "alert_match_query": [
          "src_ip:montana"
        ],
        "bytes_out": "8677",
        "http_method": "GET",
        "http_query": "/shuttle/missions/missions.html",
        "http_status": "200",
        "http_version": "HTTP/1.0",
        "identd": "-",
        "record_id": "8e861956-af54-49fd-9043-94c143fc5a19",
        "record_raw_value": "ril.usda.montana.edu - - [01/Jul/1995:03:02:18 -0400] \"GET /shuttle/missions/missions.html HTTP/1.0\" 200 8677",
        "record_time": 804582138000,
        "record_type": "apache_log",
        "src_ip": "ril.usda.montana.edu",
        "user": "-"
      }


3. Launch the script
--------------------
For this tutorial we will handle some apache logs with a splitText parser and send them to Elastiscearch
Connect a shell to your logisland container to launch the following streaming jobs.

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -i -t logisland bin/logisland.sh --conf conf/match-queries.yml

4. Inject some Apache logs into the system
------------------------------------------
Now we're going to send some logs to ``logisland_raw`` Kafka topic.

We could setup a logstash or flume agent to load some apache logs into a kafka topic
but there's a super useful tool in the Kafka ecosystem : `kafkacat <https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat>`_,
a *generic command line non-JVM Apache Kafka producer and consumer* which can be easily installed.


If you don't have your own httpd logs available, you can use some freely available log files from
`NASA-HTTP <http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/NASA-HTTP.html>`_ web site access:

- `Jul 01 to Jul 31, ASCII format, 20.7 MB gzip compressed <ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz>`_
- `Aug 04 to Aug 31, ASCII format, 21.8 MB gzip compressed <ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_logAug95.gz>`_

Let's send the first 500000 lines of NASA http access over July 1995 to LogIsland with kafkacat to ``logisland_raw`` Kafka topic

.. code-block:: sh

    cd /tmp
    wget ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz
    gunzip NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz
    head -500000 NASA_access_log_Jul95 | kafkacat -b sandbox:9092 -t logisland_raw



5. Check your alerts with Kibana
--------------------------------
Check that you've match some criterias :

.. code-block:: sh

    curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/logisland.2017.10.17/_search?pretty&q=alert_match_name:montana_host
    curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/logisland.2017.10.17/_search?pretty&q=alert_match_name:blacklisted_host

Open up your browser and go to `http://sandbox:5601/ <http://sandbox:5601/app/kibana#/discover>`_ and you should be able to explore your apache logs.


by adding filter on ``alert_match_name:blacklisted_host`` you'll only get request from ``alyssa.prodigy.com`` which is a host we where monitoring.
