Event aggregation
=================

In the following tutorial we'll learn how to generate time window metrics on some http traffic (apache log records) and
how to raise custom alerts based on lucene matching query criterion.

We assume that you already know how to parse and ingest Apache logs into logisland.
If it's not the case please refer to the previous `Apache logs indexing tutorial <index-apache-logs.html>`_.
We will first add an `SQLAggregator </plugins.html#kafkarecordstreamsqlaggregator>`_  Stream
to compute some metrics and then add a `MatchQuery </plugins.html#matchquery>`_ Processor.


.. note::

    Be sure to know of to launch a logisland Docker environment by reading the `prerequisites <./prerequisites.html>`_ section


1.Install required components
-----------------------------

For this tutorial please make sure to already have installed elasticsearch modules. If not you can just
do it through the componentes.sh command line:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/components.sh -i com.hurence.logisland:logisland-processor-elasticsearch:1.1.2

    bin/components.sh -i com.hurence.logisland:logisland-service-elasticsearch_5_4_0-client:1.1.2




2. Logisland job setup
----------------------
The logisland job for this tutorial is already packaged in the tar.gz assembly and you can find it here :

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -i -t logisland vim conf/aggregate-events.yml


We will start by explaining each part of the config file.


Our application will be composed of 4 streams :

The first one converts apache logs to typed records (please note the use of ``ConvertFieldsType`` processor)

The second one is the sql stream is a special one one use a `KafkaRecordStreamSQLAggregator </plugins.html#kafkarecordstreamsqlaggregator>`_.
This stream defines input/output topics names as well as Serializers, avro schema.

.. note::

    The `Avro <http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/spec.html>`_ schema is set for the input topic and must be same as the avro schema of the output topic for the stream that
    produces the records (please refer to `Index Apache logs tutorial <index-apache-logs.html>`_

The most important part of the `KafkaRecordStreamSQLAggregator` is its `sql.query` property which defines
a query to apply on the incoming records for the given time window.

The following SQL query will be applied on sliding window of 10" of records.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT count(*) AS connections_count, avg(bytes_out) AS avg_bytes_out, src_ip, first(record_time) as record_time
    FROM logisland_events
    GROUP BY src_ip
    ORDER BY connections_count DESC
    LIMIT 20

which will consider ``logisland_events`` topic as SQL table and create 20 output Record with the fields avg_bytes_out, src_ip & record_time.
the statement with record_time will ensure that the created Records will correspond to the effective input event time (not the actual time).


.. code-block:: yaml

             "name": "com.hurence.logisland.record.apache_log",
             "fields": [
               { "name": "record_errors",   "type": [ {"type": "array", "items": "string"},"null"] },
               { "name": "record_raw_key", "type": ["string","null"] },
               { "name": "record_raw_value", "type": ["string","null"] },
               { "name": "record_id",   "type": ["string"] },
               { "name": "record_time", "type": ["long"] },
               { "name": "record_type", "type": ["string"] },
               { "name": "src_ip",      "type": ["string","null"] },
               { "name": "http_method", "type": ["string","null"] },
               { "name": "bytes_out",   "type": ["long","null"] },
               { "name": "http_query",  "type": ["string","null"] },
               { "name": "http_version","type": ["string","null"] },
               { "name": "http_status", "type": ["string","null"] },
               { "name": "identd",      "type": ["string","null"] },
               { "name": "user",        "type": ["string","null"] }    ]}
        sql.query: >
          SELECT count(*) AS connections_count, avg(bytes_out) AS avg_bytes_out, src_ip
          FROM logisland_events
          GROUP BY src_ip
          ORDER BY event_count DESC
          LIMIT 20
        max.results.count: 1000
        output.record.type: top_client_metrics

Here we will compute every x seconds, the top twenty `src_ip` for connections count.
The result of the query will be pushed into to `logisland_aggregations` topic as new `top_client_metrics` Record containing `connections_count` and `avg_bytes_out` fields.


the third match some criteria to send some alerts

.. code-block:: yaml

    - processor: match_query
      component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.MatchQuery
      type: processor
      documentation: a parser that produce alerts from lucene queries
      configuration:
        numeric.fields: bytes_out,connections_count
        too_much_bandwidth: avg_bytes_out:[25000 TO 5000000]
        too_many_connections: connections_count:[150 TO 300]
        output.record.type: threshold_alert



3. Launch the script
--------------------
For this tutorial we will handle some apache logs with a splitText parser and send them to Elastiscearch
Connect a shell to your logisland container to launch the following streaming jobs.

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -i -t logisland bin/logisland.sh --conf conf/aggregate-events.yml

4. Inject some Apache logs into the system
------------------------------------------
Now we're going to send some logs to ``logisland_raw`` Kafka topic.

We could setup a logstash or flume agent to load some apache logs into a kafka topic
but there's a super useful tool in the Kafka ecosystem : `kafkacat <https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat>`_,
a *generic command line non-JVM Apache Kafka producer and consumer* which can be easily installed.


If you don't have your own httpd logs available, you can use some freely available log files from
`NASA-HTTP <http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/NASA-HTTP.html>`_ web site access:

- `Jul 01 to Jul 31, ASCII format, 20.7 MB gzip compressed <ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz>`_
- `Aug 04 to Aug 31, ASCII format, 21.8 MB gzip compressed <ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_logAug95.gz>`_

Let's send the first 500000 lines of NASA http access over July 1995 to LogIsland with kafkacat to ``logisland_raw`` Kafka topic

.. code-block:: sh

    cd /tmp
    wget ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz
    gunzip NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz
    head -500000 NASA_access_log_Jul95 | kafkacat -b sandbox:9092 -t logisland_raw


5. Check your alerts with Kibana
--------------------------------

As we explore data logs from july 1995 we'll have to select an absolute time filter from 1995-06-30 to 1995-07-08 to see the events.

.. image:: /_static/kibana-logisland-aggregates-events.png


you can filter your events with ``record_type:connection_alert`` to get 71733 connections alerts matching your query


.. image:: /_static/kibana-blacklisted-host.png

if we filter now on threshold alerts whith ``record_type:threshold_alert`` you'll get the 13 src_ip that have been catched by the threshold query.
