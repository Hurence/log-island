Netflow/Logisland integration - Handling Netflow traffic
========================================================

Netflow and Logisland
---------------------

`Netflow  <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/solutions_docs/netflow/nfwhite.html>`_ is a feature introduced
on Cisco routers that provides the ability to collect IP network traffic. We can distinguish 2 components:

- Flow exporter: aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records (binary format) towards flow collectors
- Flow collector: responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow data received from a flow exporter

The collected data are therefore available for analysis purpose (intrusion detection, traffic analysis...)

Network Flows:
A network flow can be defined in many ways. Cisco standard NetFlow version 5 defines a flow as a unidirectional sequence of packets that all share the following 7 values:

1. Ingress interface (SNMP ifIndex)
2. Source IP address
3. Destination IP address
4. IP protocol
5. Source port for UDP or TCP, 0 for other protocols
6. Destination port for UDP or TCP, type and code for ICMP, or 0 for other protocols
7. IP Type of Service

NetFlow Record

A NetFlow record can contain a wide variety of information about the traffic in a given flow. NetFlow version 5 (one of the most commonly used versions, followed by version 9) contains the following:

- Input interface index used by SNMP (ifIndex in IF-MIB).
- Output interface index or zero if the packet is dropped.
- Timestamps for the flow start and finish time, in milliseconds since the last boot.
- Number of bytes and packets observed in the flow
- Layer 3 headers:

  - Source & destination IP addresses
  - ICMP Type and Code.
  - IP protocol
  - Type of Service (ToS) value

- Source and destination port numbers for TCP, UDP, SCTP
- For TCP flows, the union of all TCP flags observed over the life of the flow.
- Layer 3 Routing information:

  - IP address of the immediate next-hop (not the BGP nexthop) along the route to the destination
  - Source & destination IP masks (prefix lengths in the CIDR notation)


Through its out-of-the-box Netflow processor, Logisland integrates with Netflow (V5) and is able to receive and handle Netflow events coming from a netflow collector.
By analyzing those events with Logisland, you may do some analysis for example for intrusion detection or traffic analysis.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to generate some Netflow traffic in LogIsland and how to index them in
ElasticSearch and vizualize them in Kinbana. More complexe treatment could bv done by plugging any Logisland processors after the Netflow processor.

Tutorial environment
--------------------

This tutorial aims to show how to handle Netflow traffic within LogIsland.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will generate Netflow traffic using `nfgen <https://github.com/pazdera/NetFlow-Exporter-Simulator>`_. This tool will simulate a netflow traffic and send binary netflow records on port 2055 of sandbox. A nifi instance running on sandbox will listen on that port for incoming traffic and push the binary events to a kafka broker.

We will launch two streaming processes, one for generating the corresponding Netflow LogIsland records and the second one to index them in ElasticSearch.

.. note::

  It is important to understand that in real environment Netflow traffic will be triggered by network devices (router, switches,...), so you will have to get the netflow traffic from the defined collectors, and send the corresponding record (formatted in JSON format as described before) to the Logisland service (Kafka).

.. note::

   You can download the `latest release <https://github.com/Hurence/logisland/releases>`_ of Logisland and the `YAML configuration file <https://github.com/Hurence/logisland/blob/master/logisland-framework/logisland-resources/src/main/resources/conf/index-netflow-events.yml>`_ for this tutorial which can also be found under `$LOGISLAND_HOME/conf` directory in the LogIsland container.


1. Start LogIsland as a Docker container
----------------------------------------
LogIsland is packaged as a Docker container that you can build yourself or pull from Docker Hub.
The docker container is built from a Centos 6.4 image with the following tools enabled (among others)

- Kafka
- Spark
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana
- LogIsland

Pull the image from Docker Repository (it may take some time)

.. code-block:: sh

    docker pull hurence/logisland

You should be aware that this Docker container is quite eager in RAM and will need at least 8G of memory to run smoothly.
Now run the container

.. code-block:: sh

    # run container
    docker run \
        -it \
        -p 80:80 \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        -p 2055:2055 \
        -p 3000:3000 \
        -p 9200-9300:9200-9300 \
        -p 5601:5601 \
        -p 2181:2181 \
        -p 9092:9092 \
        -p 9000:9000 \
        -p 4050-4060:4050-4060 \
        --name logisland \
        -h sandbox \
        hurence/logisland bash

    # get container ip
    docker inspect logisland

    # or if your are on mac os
    docker-machine ip default

you should add an entry for **sandbox** (with the container ip) in your ``/etc/hosts`` as it will be easier to access to all web services in logisland running container.


.. note::

    If you have your own Spark and Kafka cluster, you can download the `latest release <https://github.com/Hurence/logisland/releases>`_ and unzip on an edge node.

2. Configuration steps
-----------------------
First we have to peform some configuration steps on sandbox (to configure and start elasticsearch and nifi). We will create a dynamic template in ElasticSearch (to better handle the field mapping) using the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

  docker exec -ti logisland bash

  [root@sandbox /]# curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/netflow -d '{
    "template" : "netflow.*",
    "settings": {
      "index.refresh_interval": "5s"
    },
    "mappings" : {
      "netflowevent" : {
        "numeric_detection": true,
        "_all" : {"enabled" : false},
        "properties" : {
          "dOctets": {"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "dPkts": { "index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "dst_as": { "index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "dst_mask": { "index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "dst_ip4": { "index": "analyzed", "type": "ip" },
          "dst_port": { "index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "first":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "input":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "last":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "nexthop":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "ip" },
          "output":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "nprot":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "record_time":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "date","format": "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis" },
          "src_as":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "src_mask":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "src_ip4": { "index": "analyzed", "type": "ip" },
          "src_port":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "flags":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "tos":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "unix_nsecs":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "long" },
          "unix_secs":{"index": "analyzed", "type": "date","format": "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_second" }
        }
      }
    }
  }'

In order to send netflow V5 event (binary format) to ``logisland_raw`` Kafka topic, we will use a nifi instance which will simply listen for netflow traffic on a UDP port (we keep here the default netflow port 2055) and push these netflow records to a kafka broker (sandbox:9092 with topic ``netflow``).

1. Start nifi

   .. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -ti logisland bash
    cd /usr/local/nifi-1.1.2
    bin/nifi.sh start

   browse `http://sandbox:8080/nifi/ <http://sandbox:8080/nifi/>`_

2. Import flow template

   Download `this <https://github.com/Hurence/logisland/tree/master/logisland-documentation/_static/nifi_netflow.xml>`_ nifi template and import it using "Upload Template" in "Operator" toolbox.

   .. image:: /_static/nifi-template-dialog.png

3. Use this template to create the nifi flow

   Drag the nifi toolbar template icon in the nifi work area and choose "nifi_netflow" template, the press "ADD" button

  .. image:: /_static/nifi-drag-template.png

  You finally have the following nifi flow

  .. image:: /_static/nifi-flow.png

4. start nifi processors

  Select listenUDP processor of  nifi flow, right click on it and press "Start". Do the same for putKafka processor.

  .. note::

    the PutFile processor is only for debugging purpose. It dumps netflow records to /tmp/netflow directory (that should be previously created). So you normally don't have to start it for that demo.

3. Parse Netflow records
-------------------------
For this tutorial we will handle netflow binary events, generate corresponding logisland records and store them to Elastiscearch

Connect a shell to your logisland container to launch the following streaming jobs.

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -ti logisland bash
    cd $LOGISLAND_HOME
    bin/logisland.sh --conf conf/index-netflow-events.yml

Setup Spark/Kafka streaming engine
__________________________________
An Engine is needed to handle the stream processing. This ``conf/index-netflow-events.yml`` configuration file defines a stream processing job setup.
The first section configures the Spark engine (we will use a `KafkaStreamProcessingEngine <../plugins.html#kafkastreamprocessingengine>`_) as well as an Elasticsearch service that will be used later in the BulkAddElasticsearch processor.

.. code-block:: yaml

 engine:
  component: com.hurence.logisland.engine.spark.KafkaStreamProcessingEngine
  type: engine
  documentation: Index Netflow events with LogIsland
  configuration:
    spark.app.name: IndexNetFlowEventsDemo
    spark.master: local[4]
    spark.driver.memory: 1G
    spark.driver.cores: 1
    spark.executor.memory: 2G
    spark.executor.instances: 4
    spark.executor.cores: 2
    spark.yarn.queue: default
    spark.yarn.maxAppAttempts: 4
    spark.yarn.am.attemptFailuresValidityInterval: 1h

    spark.streaming.batchDuration: 4000
    spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled: false
    spark.streaming.unpersist: false
    spark.streaming.blockInterval: 500
    spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition: 3000
    spark.streaming.timeout: -1
    spark.streaming.unpersist: false
    spark.streaming.kafka.maxRetries: 3
    spark.streaming.ui.retainedBatches: 200
    spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable: false
    spark.ui.port: 4050

  controllerServiceConfigurations:

    - controllerService: elasticsearch_service
      component: com.hurence.logisland.service.elasticsearch.Elasticsearch_2_4_0_ClientService
      type: service
      documentation: elasticsearch 2.4.0 service implementation
      configuration:
        hosts: sandbox:9300
        cluster.name: elasticsearch
        batch.size: 20000

  streamConfigurations:

Stream 1 : parse incoming Netflow (Binary format) lines
_______________________________________________________
Inside this engine you will run a Kafka stream of processing, so we setup input/output topics and Kafka/Zookeeper hosts.
Here the stream will read all the logs sent in ``logisland_raw`` topic and push the processing output into ``logisland_events`` topic.

We can define some serializers to marshall all records from and to a topic.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Parsing
    - stream: parsing_stream
      component: com.hurence.logisland.stream.spark.KafkaRecordStreamParallelProcessing
      type: stream
      documentation: A processor chain that transforms Netflow events into Logisland records
      configuration:
        kafka.input.topics: netflow
        kafka.output.topics: logisland_events
        kafka.error.topics: logisland_errors
        kafka.input.topics.serializer: none
        kafka.output.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.KryoSerializer
        kafka.error.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.JsonSerializer
        kafka.metadata.broker.list: sandbox:9092
        kafka.zookeeper.quorum: sandbox:2181
        kafka.topic.autoCreate: true
        kafka.topic.default.partitions: 2
        kafka.topic.default.replicationFactor: 2
      processorConfigurations:

Within this stream there is a single processor in the processor chain: the Netflow processor. It takes an incoming Netflow event/notice binary record, parses it and computes a Logisland Record as a sequence of fields that were contained in the binary record.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Transform Netflow events into Logisland records
        - processor: Netflow adaptor
          component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.netflow.ParseNetflowEvent
          type: parser
          documentation: A processor that transforms Netflow events into LogIsland events
          configuration:
            debug: false
            enrich.record: false

This stream will process log entries as soon as they will be queued into ``logisland_raw`` Kafka topics, each log will be parsed as an event which will be pushed back to Kafka in the ``logisland_events`` topic.

Stream 2: Index the processed records into Elasticsearch
________________________________________________________

The second Kafka stream will handle ``Records`` pushed into the ``logisland_events`` topic to index them into ElasticSearch. So there is no need to define an output topic:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Indexing
    - stream: indexing_stream
      component: com.hurence.logisland.stream.spark.KafkaRecordStreamParallelProcessing
      type: processor
      documentation: A processor chain that pushes netflow events to ES
      configuration:
        kafka.input.topics: logisland_events
        kafka.output.topics: none
        kafka.error.topics: logisland_errors
        kafka.input.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.KryoSerializer
        kafka.output.topics.serializer: none
        kafka.error.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.JsonSerializer
        kafka.metadata.broker.list: sandbox:9092
        kafka.zookeeper.quorum: sandbox:2181
        kafka.topic.autoCreate: true
        kafka.topic.default.partitions: 2
        kafka.topic.default.replicationFactor: 1
      processorConfigurations:

The only processor in the processor chain of this stream is the ``BulkAddElasticsearch`` processor.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Bulk add into ElasticSearch
    - processor: ES Publisher
      component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.elasticsearch.BulkAddElasticsearch
      type: processor
      documentation: A processor that pushes Netflow events into ES
      configuration:
        elasticsearch.client.service: elasticsearch_service
        default.index: netflow
        default.type: events
        timebased.index: today
        es.index.field: search_index
        es.type.field: record_type

The ``default.index: netflow`` configuration parameter tells the processor to index events into
an index starting with the ``netflow`` string.
The ``timebased.index: today`` configuration parameter tells the processor to use the current date after the index prefix. Thus the index name is of the form ``/netflow.2017.03.30``.

Finally, the ``es.type.field: record_type`` configuration parameter tells the processor to use the
record field ``record_type`` of the incoming record to determine the ElasticSearch type to use within the index.

4. Inject Netflow events into the system
--------------------------------------------


Generate Netflow events to port 2055 of localhost
_________________________________________________

Now that we have our nifi flow listening on port 2055 from Netflow (V5) traffic and push them to kafka, we have to generate netflow traffic. For the purpose of this tutorial, as already mentioned,  we will install and use a netflow traffic generator (but you can use whatever other way to generate Netflow V5 traffic to port 2055)

.. code-block:: sh

  docker exec -ti logisland bash
  cd /tmp
  wget https://github.com/pazdera/NetFlow-Exporter-Simulator/archive/master.zip
  unzip master.zip
  cd NetFlow-Exporter-Simulator-master/
  make
  ./nfgen   #this command will generate netflow V5 traffic and send it to local port 2055.

5. Monitor your spark jobs and Kafka topics
-------------------------------------------
Now go to `http://sandbox:4050/streaming/ <http://sandbox:4050/streaming/>`_ to see how fast Spark can process
your data

  .. image:: /_static/spark-job-monitoring.png

6. Use Kibana to inspect events
--------------------------------

Inspect Netflow events under ``Discover`` tab
_____________________________________________

Open your browser and go to `http://sandbox:5601/ <http://sandbox:5601/app/kibana#/settings/indices/?_g=(refreshInterval:(display:Off,pause:!f,value:0),time:(from:now-15m,mode:quick,to:now))>`_

Configure a new index pattern with ``netflow.*`` as the pattern name and ``@timestamp`` as the time value field.

  .. image:: /_static/kibana-configure-index-netflow.png


Then browse `"Discover" tab <http://sandbox:5601/app/kibana#/discover?_g=(refreshInterval:(display:'5%20seconds',pause:!f,section:1,value:5000),time:(from:now-1h,mode:relative,to:now))>`_, you should be able to explore your Netflow events.

  .. image:: /_static/kibana-logisland-metrics-netflow.png

You have now to save your search by clicking the save icon. Save this search as "netflowsearch"

  .. image:: /_static/kibana-save-search.png

Display network information in kibana dashboard
_______________________________________________

First, you need to import the predefined Kibana dashboard (download `this file <https://github.com/Hurence/logisland/tree/master/logisland-documentation/_static/netflow_dashboard.json>`_ first) under ``Settings`` tab, ``Objetcs`` subtab.

Select ``Import`` and load previously saved netflow_dashboard.json dashboard (it also contains required Kibana visualizations)

  .. image:: /_static/kibana-logisland-import-dashboard.png

Then visit ``Dashboard`` tab, and open ``dashboard_netflow`` dashboard by clicking on ``Load Saved Dashboard``.  You should be able to visualize information about the generated traffic (choose the right time window, corresponding to the time of your traffic, in the right upper corner of kibana page)

  .. image:: /_static/kibana-logisland-dashboard.png
