================================================
Run Logisland stream within Kubernetes : stage 1
================================================
This is the begining of a multiple part series of tutorials going through setting up a scalable Apache log indexation to Elasticsearch in kubernetes. This guide will bring you to a fully functionnal Kubernetes logisland setup.

Part 1 - Setting up Elasticsearch
Part 2 - Setting up Kibana
Part 3 - Setting up a three-node Zookeeper cluster
Part 4 - Setting up a three-node Kafka cluster
Part 5 - Setting up Logisland


Kafka and Zookeeper can be manually scaled up at any time by altering and re-applying configuration.
Kubernetes also provides features for autoscaling, read more about auto scaling Kubernetes Pods should that be a requirement.

0 - Pre-requisites & initial setup
----------------------------------
First of all you'll need a Kubernetes cluster or a minikube cluster (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/ ).
For the first option I would highly recommend to follow the Hello Minikube tutorial for those who don't have any background with Kubernetes.
This will help to get minikube and kubectl commands installed.
(Minikube is the local development Kubernetes environment and kubectl is the command line interface used to interact with Kubernetes cluster).


Shaving the Yak!
""""""""""""""""
One or two commands that used in this post will be mac or linux specific. Reference this guide to get more up to date and OS specific commands.
Once you’ve got the tools all installed, you can now follow along these steps to create a single node Elasticsearch cluster.

If you are using Minikube, make sure that its started properly by running this command

* for mac:

.. code-block:: sh

    minikube start --vm-driver=hyperkit

* for linux (use virtualbox by default, so you have to install it) :

.. code-block:: sh

    minikube start

Now set the Minikube context. The context is what determines which cluster kubectl is interacting with.

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl config use-context minikube

Verify that kubectl is configured to communicate with your cluster:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl cluster-info

To view the nodes in the cluster, run

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl get nodes


Kubernetes Dashboard
""""""""""""""""""""
Minikube includes the kubernetes dashboard as an addon which you can enable.

.. code-block:: sh

    minikube addons list

returns

.. code-block:: sh

    - default-storageclass: enabled
    - coredns: disabled
    - kube-dns: enabled
    - ingress: disabled
    - registry: disabled
    - registry-creds: disabled
    - addon-manager: enabled
    - dashboard: enabled
    - storage-provisioner: enabled
    - heapster: disabled
    - efk: disabled

You can enable an addon using:

.. code-block:: sh

    minikube addons enable dashboard

You can then open the dashboard with command

.. code-block:: sh

    minikube dashboard

Please note that on some virtual environments (like VirtualBox) the minikube VM may start with too few resources (you should allocate at least 4 CPUs and 6Go RAM)

Kubernetes setup
""""""""""""""""
The best you can do is to follow the official guides to get the following tools up and running.

The Kubernetes command-line tool, **kubectl**, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs. `setup kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>`_

Minikube, a tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine on your laptop is the easiest way to start with. `setup minikube <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/>`_

.. note::

    Deciding where to run Kubernetes depends on what resources you have available and how much flexibility you need. You can run Kubernetes almost anywhere, from your laptop to VMs on a cloud provider to a rack of bare metal servers. You can also set up a fully-managed cluster by running a single command or craft your own customized cluster on your bare metal servers. `setup kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/>`_


Namespace
"""""""""
In this guide, I use the fictional namespace `logisland`. You can create this namespace in your cluster or use your own.

Create the file `namespace.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: logisland

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./namespace.yml

If you wish to use your own namespace for this Kafka installation, be sure to replace `logisland` in the configurations below.

Persistent volumes
""""""""""""""""""
In Kubernetes, managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute.
The PersistentVolume subsystem provides an API for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed.
To do this we introduce two new API resources: PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim.

A **PersistentVolume (PV)** is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator.
It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes,
but have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the PV. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage,
 be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

A **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources.
Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory).
Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).

Create the local folders where you want to store your files (change this to wherever you want to store data on your nodes) :

.. code-block:: sh

    mkdir /tmp/data

Create the file `pv-volume.yml`

.. code-block:: yml

    kind: PersistentVolume
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: datadir
      labels:
        app: kafka
        type: local
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      storageClassName: manual
      capacity:
        storage: 10Gi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      hostPath:
        path: "/tmp/data"

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./pv-volume.yml




Configuration maps
""""""""""""""""""
We will need a few configuration variables in our setup to bind containers together and define some environment variables.
The first config map is specific to `loggen` tool which is a wrapped python program that sends fake generated apache logs to a given Kafka topic at a specified rate.
The second one is a set of settings that will be used by the `logisland` job in order to configure itself. We'll go into deeper details in the last section of this post.

Create the file `config-maps.yml` with the following content

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: special-config
      namespace: logisland
    data:
      loggen.sleep: '0.2'
      loggen.num: '0'
      loggen.topic: logisland_raw
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: logisland-config
      namespace: logisland
    data:
      kafka.brokers: kafka:9092
      zk.quorum: zookeeper:2181
      es.hosts: elasticsearch:9300
      es.cluster.name: es-logisland


Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./config-maps.yml



1 - Setting up Elasticsearch cluster on Kubernetes
--------------------------------------------------



Single Node Elasticsearch Cluster
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Create the file `elasticsearch-service.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: elasticsearch
      namespace: logisland
      labels:
        component: elasticsearch
    spec:
      type: ClusterIP
      selector:
        component: elasticsearch
      ports:
        - name: http
          port: 9200
          protocol: TCP
        - name: tcp
          port: 9300
          protocol: TCP

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./elasticsearch-service.yml


Create the file `elasticsearch-deployment.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: elasticsearch
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          component: elasticsearch
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            component: elasticsearch
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: elasticsearch
              image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.4.3
              env:
                - name: discovery.type
                  value: single-node
                - name: cluster.name
                  value: "es-logisland"
                - name: xpack.security.enabled
                  value: "false"
              ports:
                - containerPort: 9200
                  name: http
                  protocol: TCP
                - containerPort: 9300
                  name: tcp
                  protocol: TCP

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./elasticsearch-deployment.yml

Expose the cluster
""""""""""""""""""
We can verify that the cluster is running by looking at the logs. But, let’s check if elasticsearch api is responding first.

In a seperate shell window, excute the following to start a proxy into Kubernetes cluster.

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl -n logisland port-forward svc/elasticsearch 9200:9200


Now, back in the other window, lets execute a curl command to get the response from the pod via the proxy.

.. code-block:: sh

    curl http://localhost:9200

Outputs:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "name" : "19SlwE4",
      "cluster_name" : "es-logisland",
      "cluster_uuid" : "ef41SIbWRHmSDoDhcFA9WA",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "5.4.3",
        "build_hash" : "eed30a8",
        "build_date" : "2017-06-22T00:34:03.743Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "6.5.1"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }

Great, everything is working.


2 - Setup Kibana
----------------
Let’s try to setup kibana pointing to our elasticsearch single node cluster.

Create the file `kibana-service.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: kibana
      namespace: logisland
      labels:
        component: kibana
    spec:
      type: NodePort
      selector:
        component: kibana
      ports:
        - name: http
          port: 5601
          targetPort: 5601
          nodePort: 30123
          protocol: TCP

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./kibana-service.yml


Create the file `kibana-deployment.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: kibana
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          component: kibana
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            component: kibana
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: kibana
              image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:5.4.3
              env:
                - name: ELASTICSEARCH_URL
                  value: http://elasticsearch:9200
                - name: XPACK_SECURITY_ENABLED
                  value: "true"
              ports:
                - containerPort: 5601
                  name: http
                  protocol: TCP

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./kibana-deployment.yml


To access kibana through your localhost forward the port

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl -n logisland port-forward svc/kibana 5601:5601


3 - Setting up Zookeeper
------------------------
Kafka requires Zookeeper for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services to coordinate its nodes.


Zookeeper Headless Service
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Kubernetes Services are persistent and provide a stable and reliable way to connect to Pods.

Setup a Kubernetes Service named kafka-zookeeper in namespace `logisland`. The kafka-zookeeper service resolves the domain name kafka-zookeeper to an internal ClusterIP.
The automatically assigned ClusterIP uses Kubernetes internal proxy to load balance calls to any Pods found from the configured selector,
in this case, app: kafka-zookeeper.

After setting up the kafka-zookeeper Service, a DNS lookup from within the cluster may produce a result similar to the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    # nslookup kafka-zookeeper
    Server:        10.96.0.10
    Address:    10.96.0.10#53

    Name:    kafka-zookeeper.logisland.svc.cluster.local
    Address: 10.103.184.71

In the example above, 10.103.184.71 is the internal IP address of the ** kafka-zookeeper* service itself and proxies calls
to one of the Zookeeper Pods it finds labeled app: kafka-zookeeper. At this point, no Pods are available until added further down.
However, the service finds them when they become active.

Create the file `zookeeper-service.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: kafka-zookeeper
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: client
          port: 2181
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: client
      selector:
        app: kafka-zookeeper
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./zookeeper-service.yml

Zookeeper Headless Service
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
A Kubernetes Headless Service does not resolve to a single IP; instead, Headless Services returns the IP addresses of any Pods found by their selector, in this case, Pods labeled app: kafka-zookeeper.

Once Pods labeled app: kafka-zookeeper are running, this Headless Service returns the results of an in-cluster DNS lookup similar to the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    # nslookup kafka-zookeeper
    Server:        10.96.0.10
    Address:    10.96.0.10#53

    Name:    kafka-zookeeper-headless.logisland.svc.cluster.local
    Address: 192.168.108.150
    Name:    kafka-zookeeper-headless.logisland.svc.cluster.local
    Address: 192.168.108.181
    Name:    kafka-zookeeper-headless.logisland.svc.cluster.local
    Address: 192.168.108.132

In the example above, the Kubernetes Service kafka-zookeeper-headless returned the internal IP addresses of three individual Pods.

At this point, no Pod IPs can be returned until the Pods are configured in the StatefulSet further down.

Create the file `zookeeper-service-headless.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: kafka-zookeeper-headless
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      #clusterIP: None
      ports:
        - name: client
          port: 2181
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 2181
        - name: election
          port: 3888
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 3888
        - name: server
          port: 2888
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 2888
      selector:
        app: kafka-zookeeper
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./zookeeper-service-headless.yml

Zookeeper StatefulSet
"""""""""""""""""""""
Kubernetes StatefulSets offer stable and unique network identifiers, persistent storage, ordered deployments, scaling,
deletion, termination, and automated rolling updates.

Unique network identifiers and persistent storage are essential for stateful cluster nodes in systems like Zookeeper and
Kafka. While it seems strange to have a coordinator like Zookeeper running inside a Kubernetes cluster sitting on its
own coordinator Etcd,
it makes sense since these systems are built to run independently. Kubernetes supports running services like Zookeeper
and Kafka with features like headless services and stateful sets which demonstrates the flexibility of Kubernetes as
both a microservices platform and a type of virtual infrastructure.

The following configuration creates three kafka-zookeeper Pods, kafka-zookeeper-0, kafka-zookeeper-1, kafka-zookeeper-2
and can be scaled to as many as desired. Ensure that the number of specified replicas matches the environment variable
ZK_REPLICAS specified in the container spec.

Pods in this StatefulSet run the Zookeeper Docker image gcr.io/google_samples/k8szk:v3, which is a sample image provided
by Google for testing GKE, it is recommended to use custom and maintained Zookeeper image once you are familiar with this setup.

Create the file `zookeeper-statefulset.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: StatefulSet
    metadata:
      name: kafka-zookeeper
      namespace: logisland

            - emptyDir: {}
              name: data
      updateStrategy:
        type: OnDelete

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./zookeeper-statefulset.yml

Zookeeper PodDisruptionBudget
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
PodDisruptionBudget can help keep the Zookeeper service stable during Kubernetes administrative events such as draining
a node or updating Pods.

From the official documentation for PDB (PodDisruptionBudget):

A PDB specifies the number of replicas that an application can tolerate having, relative to how many it is intended to
have. For example, a Deployment which has a .spec.replicas: 5 is supposed to have 5 pods at any given time. If its PDB
allows for there to be 4 at a time, then the Eviction API will allow voluntary disruption of one, but not two pods, at a time.

The configuration below tells Kubernetes that we can only tolerate one of our Zookeeper Pods down at any given time.
maxUnavailable may be set to a higher number if we increase the number of Zookeeper Pods in the StatefulSet.

Create the file `zookeeper-disruptionbudget.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
    kind: PodDisruptionBudget
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kafka-zookeeper
      name: kafka-zookeeper
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: kafka-zookeeper

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./zookeeper-disruptionbudget.yml





4 - Setting up Kafka
--------------------
Once Zookeeper is up and running we have satisfied the requirements for Kafka. Kafka is set up in a similar
configuration to Zookeeper, utilizing a Service, Headless Service and a StatefulSet.

Kafka Service
"""""""""""""
The following Service provides a persistent internal Cluster IP address that proxies and load balance requests to Kafka
Pods found with the label app: kafka and exposing the port 9092.

Create the file `kafka-service.yml`:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: kafka
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: broker
          port: 9092
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: kafka
      selector:
        app: kafka
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./kafka-service.yml

Kafka Headless Service
""""""""""""""""""""""
The following Headless Service provides a list of Pods and their internal IPs found with the label app: kafka and exposing the port 9092. The previously created Service: kafka always returns a persistent IP assigned at the creation time of the Service. The following kafka-headless services return the domain names and IP address of individual Pods and are liable to change as Pods are added, removed or updated.

Create the file `kafka-service-headless.yml`:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: kafka-headless
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      #clusterIP: None
      ports:
        - name: broker
          port: 9092
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 9092
      selector:
        app: kafka
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./kafka-service-headless.yml

Kafka StatefulSet
"""""""""""""""""
The following StatefulSet deploys Pods running the confluentinc/cp-kafka:4.1.2-2 Docker image from Confluent.

Each pod is assigned 1Gi of storage using the rook-block storage class. See Rook.io for more information on file, block, and object storage services for cloud-native environments.

Create the file `kafka-statefulset.yml`:

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: StatefulSet
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kafka
      name: kafka

    kubectl create -f ./kafka-statefulset.yml

Kafka Test Pod
""""""""""""""
Add a test Pod to help explore and debug your new Kafka cluster. The Confluent Docker image
confluentinc/cp-kafka:4.1.2-2 used for the test Pod is the same as our nodes from the StatefulSet and
contain useful command in the /usr/bin/ folder.

Create the file kafka-test.yml:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: kafka-test-client
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      containers:
        - command:
            - sh
            - -c
            - exec tail -f /dev/null
          image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:4.1.2-2
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          name: kafka
          resources: {}
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          terminationMessagePolicy: File

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./kafka-test.yml






5 - Working with Kafka
----------------------
If you have deployed the kafka-test-client pod from the configuration above, the following commands should get you started with some basic operations:

Create Topic
""""""""""""
.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl -n logisland exec kafka-test-client -- \
    /usr/bin/kafka-topics --zookeeper kafka-zookeeper:2181 \
    --topic logisland_raw --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1

List Topics
"""""""""""
.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl -n logisland exec kafka-test-client -- \
/usr/bin/kafka-topics --zookeeper kafka-zookeeper:2181 --list

Sending logs to Kafka
"""""""""""""""""""""
This script generates a boatload of fake apache logs very quickly.
Its useful for generating fake workloads for data ingest and/or analytics applications.
It can write log lines to console, to log files or directly to gzip files. Or to kafka ...
It utilizes the excellent Faker library to generate realistic ip's, URI's etc.

Create the file `loggen-deployment.yml`:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: loggen-job
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: loggen
          image: hurence/loggen
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          env:
            - name: LOGGEN_SLEEP
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: special-config
                  key: loggen.sleep
            - name: LOGGEN_NUM
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: special-config
                  key: loggen.num
            - name: LOGGEN_KAFKA
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: logisland-config
                  key: kafka.brokers
            - name: LOGGEN_KAFKA_TOPIC
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: special-config
                  key: loggen.topic

Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./loggen-deployment.yml


Listen on a Topic
"""""""""""""""""
make sure some fake apache logs are flowing through kafka topic

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl -n logisland exec -ti kafka-test-client -- \
    /usr/bin/kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
    --topic logisland_raw --from-beginning












6 - Setup logisland
-------------------
It's now time time to dive into log mining. We'll setup a 3 instances logisland stream that will handle apache logs parsing (coming from loggen script) as a ReplicaSet


Create the file `logisland-deployment.yml`:

.. code-block:: yml

    apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
    kind: ReplicaSet
    metadata:
      name: logisland-job
      namespace: logisland
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: logisland-job
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: logisland-job
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: logisland
              image: hurence/logisland-job
              imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
              command: ["/opt/logisland/bin/logisland.sh"]
              args: ["--standalone", "--conf", "/opt/logisland/conf/index-apache-logs-plainjava.yml"]
              env:
                - name: ES_CLUSTER_NAME
                  valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                      name: logisland-config
                      key: es.cluster.name
                - name: KAFKA_BROKERS
                  valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                      name: logisland-config
                      key: kafka.brokers
                - name: ES_HOSTS
                  valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                      name: logisland-config
                      key: es.hosts


Apply the configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    kubectl create -f ./logisland-deployment.yml


run the following command to see events parsed by logisland flowing through the output topic


    kubectl -n logisland exec -ti kafka-test-client --     /usr/bin/kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9092     --topic logisland_events


check that logs are correctly stored into elasticsearch

    kubectl -n logisland exec -ti kafka-test-client --     curl http://elasticsearch:9200/logisland.*/_search?pretty=1
